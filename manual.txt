------------
1. collect_labels - collects the labels from the pretty print dataset and saves it as collected_label.json file
2. collect_policy_text - collects all the policy text from the sanitized policies and saved it as collect_policy_text.json file
3. collect_combined_data - combines the labels and policy text and saves it as collect_combined_data.json file
4. collect_clean_combined_data - filters the invalid labels and saves the valid label dataset as collect_clean_combined_data.json
5. collect_label_support - collects the label support from the clean_combined_data.json file to label_support.json
6. collect_top_labels - collects the top label from label_support.json to x_top_labels.json
7. collect_top_label_dataset - collects the top labels dataset including the policy text as x_top_labels_dataset.json
8. baseline_model_tfidf - baseline model that classifies the multi labels using tfidf as a vectorizer
9. baseline_model_word2vec - baseline model that classifies multi labels using word2vec as a vectorizer
